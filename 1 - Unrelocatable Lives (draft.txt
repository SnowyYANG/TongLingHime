Although many scientists opposed, the government still decided to build a large hydropower station on the river.
The construction of hydroelectric power stations would flood many areas, so the relocation work started.
In a small remote village, a young girl didn't want to move out. In her eyes, this village was the place where her forefathers lived for generations.
The villagers initially supported her not to move, but the government's stance was tough, and gradually most villagers agreed to move.
There was only one man who did not agree to move out like the girl. He did something unexpected.
A villager who lead agreeing to relocate disappeared and later found died.
Another villager who agreed to relocate disappeared and died.
Then another...
Fear spread among the villagers. The police took the man away and the girl also felt guilty.
In the end, the girl moved away with the villagers. The hydropower station was built. The remaining animals and plants that could not relocate were drowned in water, and some became resentful spirits.
Some of the drawn animals and plants's souls were from the neighboring country.
In the following years, several deadly natural disasters occurred in the surrounding area of the hydropower station. No body knew if it was caused by drowned spirits.
