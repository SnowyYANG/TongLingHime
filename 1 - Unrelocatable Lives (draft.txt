Although many scientists were opposed to it, the government still decided to build a large hydropower station on the river.
The construction of hydroelectric power stations would flood many areas, so the relocation work started.
In a small remote village, a young girl didn't want to move out. In her eyes, this village was the place where her forefathers lived for generations.
The villagers initially supported her not to move, but the government's stance was tough, and gradually most villagers agreed to move.
There was only one man who did not agree to move out like the girl. He did something unexpected.
A villager who led agreeing to relocate disappeared and later found dead.
Another villager who agreed to relocate disappeared and died.
Then another...
Fear spread among the villagers. The police took the man away and the girl also felt guilty.
In the end, the girl and the villagers moved away from the village. The hydropower station was built. The remaining animals and plants that could not relocate were drowned in water, and some became resentful spirits.
Some of the drawn animals and plants' souls were from the neighboring country.
In the following years, several deadly natural disasters occurred in the surrounding area of the hydropower station. Nobody knew if it was caused by drowned spirits.
